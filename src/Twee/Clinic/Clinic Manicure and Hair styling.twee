	Nancy has you sit in the spa chair, soaking your hands and feet in a pleasantly-warm bath salt solution while she prepares her equipment. She goes in the back, and returns with a unique manicure kit wrapped in a specially-sealed bag.

	She gives your hands and feet a relaxing rubdown, then applies a soothing pomice scrub to them, removing any traces of hair and leaving your skin soft and smooth. However, she doesn’t stop there.

		Nancy sits you down in the salon chair.  @@.nurse;“I’m so glad you wanted to get your hair done,”@@ she states.  @@.nurse;“I think this style will look great on you.”@@

		She starts adding some hair extensions.  They don’t add much length but they do add a lot more fullness and volume to your hair.

		Once she gets the length she wants, she begins doing a very light trim and style.

		When done, your hair looks more androgynous than truly feminine, but it has definitely improved your look.

		@@.nurse;“There,”@@ Nancy says, @@.nurse;“this should last a month or even a couple before you’ll need the extensions touched up again.  I hope to see you again soon if you want to try a different look!”@@

		@@.nurse;“I’m so glad you wanted to get your hair done!”@@ Nancy beams. @@.nurse;“I think this style will look great on you.”@@
		
		She smiles congenially, leading you over to a purpose-made salon chair. As you settle in to the plush, comfortable seat, you’re naturally draw to your reflection in the large, wall-mounted mirror. Meeting your gaze in the glass, Nancy fluffs your hair with her fingers, then tilts your head back and forth to examine your bone structure in the light.

		With the press of a foot pedal, Nancy lowers and adjusts your chair for the best working angle, draping an apron over you as she does. She lightly sprays a refreshing misting of water over your hair, then draws a comb gently over your scalp. Her light touch is soothing.
		
		Nancy starts by adding some length to your hair with extensions. The newly-lengthened strands reach just below your neck, adding a good deal of volume to your hair as well. You glimpse the locks as they brush your shoulders, and see that Nancy has a practiced eye for this - they’re an uncanny match for your own hair color, except for their augmented highlights.

		When she’s done with that first step, your hair is long and even, but mostly formless. She counters that with several pairs of specialized scissors, combs and sprays that she brings into her process.

		You watch your reflection transform as the expert stylist sections off your hair and adds layer and dimension to it. Blending away any trace of the extensions’ attachments, it’s not long before it all looks like a seamless whole.
		
		Nancy loosely wraps your tresses above your head, and exchanges her other tools for a specially-nozzled blow dryer and a big, round brush. She pauses to spritz in something from a little bottle before each application of the blower. Then, bringing down layers of hair one lock a time, she adds a blowout that greatly boosts your hair’s volume and leaves the ends lightly curled.
		
		As the last few strands are put in place, Nancy gives them a final once-over. It’s apparent that she’s given a distinctly feminine mode to your look. Her styling has subtly changed your hair- and fall-lines, creating the skillful illusion of a girlish facial shape. 
		
		Your hair is soft, shiny and fashionably highlighted in a beautiful hairstyle.

		@@.nurse;“There,”@@ Nancy says, @@.nurse;“this should last a month or even a couple before you’ll need the extensions touched up again. I hope to see you again soon if you want to try a different look!”@@

		She starts adding some length to your hair with hair extensions.  These extensions are premium and go all the way down to the middle of your back!  As a bonus, these extensions have a very feminine permanent wave in them.  You will have very little maintenance to do with this style and you will always look fantastic with it!

		When done, your hair looks extremely feminine and you are actually starting to enjoy this hair style quite a bit.

		Nancy leads you towards a purpose-made salon chair and helps you relax in its cushioned seat. She swishes an apron over your body, and tells you to get comfortable. 
		
		@@.nurse;“I bet you’re going to just //love// this look!”@@ Nancy says animatedly.
		
		Stepping on the adjustment pedals, she lowers and spins your chair to maneuver you into the best position to work from. You look in the mirror as Nancy starts to examine your head and face, turning your chin this way and that as she decides on her approach.
		
		Taking out some highly convincing hair extensions, Nancy begins to work. As she threads in the extra locks, which are a near-perfect match to your own color, you notice a marked increase in the overall length and volume of your hair. The lengthened strands drape a good bit past your shoulder blade in back, and down over your collarbone in front.
		
		She follows up with a careful trim to blend all the parts together. When she’s through, you’d never have guessed your extensions weren’t a natural part of your own hair, if they weren’t on your own head. Nancy immediately takes a bottle of a fruity-smelling styling product and pours it in, working your wet-down hair into even parts.
		
		@@.nurse;“This is probably the best curling serum ever! It’s got a keratin strength booster, a static reducer and a shine enhancer. It’s got the //best// long-term hold, but it doesn’t make your hair stiff at all, which is a-maz-ing.”@@
		
		You have almost no idea what any of that implies, but you nod appreciatively upon noticing it smells good and feels pleasantly tingly. Nancy gives the serum several minutes to set in, then grabs a titanium curling iron and turns your chair to face her. You lose sight of the mirror, and have to trust Nancy’s skills.
		
		Nancy works your hair expertly for the next several minutes, twirling the strands tightly over the long, shiny wand. You watch as the strands individually come away dry and curly, though you can’t tell the overall effect of all this yet. Your bangs get a slightly different treatment, and come to rest in a line just above your brow, where she evens them up with a pair of scissors.
		
		When she’s finished with the iron, she works on arranging your hair for a bit, eyes furrowed in deep concentration. The overall length of your hair seems to have been shortened quite a bit by the curling process, and you can feel they mostly just brush against your chin and neck.
		
		With a few final flourishes, Nancy turns you back towards the mirror, lifting her hands to either side of your head in a “voilà” gesture.
		
		Looking at your reflection, you see your hair has been styled in a loosened up-do of fancy ringlets, with your face framed by curls and a girly set of bangs over your forehead. Nancy has also used your hair’s placement in subtle fashion, to make your face’s lines look feminine and petite. You look like someone brought a doll to life!
		
		@@.nurse;“You. Are. Adorbs!”@@ Nancy squeals, clapping her upright hands together in a little arch. @@.nurse;“It’s so much better than I even thought! And, your hairstyle will last for a long time before you have to get the extensions touched up. You get to look //super// cute every day!”@@
