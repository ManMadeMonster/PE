		A shrill beeping startles you, and you realize $guardian’s alarm clock is going off.  You quickly duck out of the bedroom before she opens her eyes.

		You suddenly realize that $guardian’s breathing has stopped, and fearing that she knows you’re there, you quickly and quietly tip-toe out.

	You don’t want to press your luck any further, so you quietly tip-toe out of $guardian’s bedroom.
