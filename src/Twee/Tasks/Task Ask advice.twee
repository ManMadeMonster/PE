	Extremely embarrassed, you walk up to a girl you know from class and ask her about the first random, girly thing that pops into your head.
	
	At first she stares at you in shock, but soon her expression is replaced by a smug smile. She goes on to give you a long “girl talk,” giving you way more information than you expected.
	
	Your cheeks are burning bright red as you thank her, making your way to class. In parting, she tells you to come again if you have any more questions.
	
	@@.hero;She is totally going to gossip about this.@@
