You wait for a while near the food court, wondering how you can get a guy to hit on you.

	<<if (random(10) gt 0) or (_sl lt 26)>>\
	Deciding that waiting further is pointless, you decide to act.

	<<else>>\
	To your surprise some guy walks up to you and attempts a cheesy pick-up line.
	
	@@.hero;Huh?!@@
	You just check your phone, thank the guy (to his confusion) and walk off, happy you were able to finish this task so quickly.

	<<if (_slb lt 5)>>\
	<<set $tasksTeacher.getHitOn.status = 2>>\
	To your surprise, his girlfriend comes up and encourages him to help you out. Blushing and staring daggers at you, the guy allows you to film his awkward pick-up attempt while his girlfriend chokes back her own laughter from outside the shot.
	
	You thank them and leave quickly before the guy gets rid of his girlfriend and smashes your face.
	
	[[Return|Go to the mall]]
	<<else>>\
	Suddenly, a girl walks up and slaps you for hitting on her boyfriend. You make your escape, leaving the guy to explain himself to his girlfriend.
